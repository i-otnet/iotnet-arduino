#include "IoTNet.h"

// This file serves as the main entry point for IoTNet library
// The actual implementation is in the platform-specific files
// (e.g., IoTNetESP32.cpp for ESP32)

// No additional code needed here as all functionality is implemented
// in the platform-specific implementation files
